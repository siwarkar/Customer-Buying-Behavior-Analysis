# Customer Buying Behavior Prediction

## Project Description  
This project analyzes customer demographic data to predict **buying behavior** using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to understand how factors such as **age and salary** influence purchasing decisions and to help businesses design **data-driven marketing strategies**.

---

## Overview  
This repository presents an **end-to-end Machine Learning project** that demonstrates the complete data science workflow, including:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering and selection  
- Model building and evaluation  

The project focuses on a **business analytics use case**, enabling organizations to identify customers who are more likely to purchase a product.

## Business Problem  
Organizations aim to optimize marketing efforts by targeting customers with a higher probability of purchase. Accurate buying behavior prediction helps in:

- Targeted and personalized marketing  
- Improved conversion rates  
- Reduced marketing and acquisition costs

## Methodology  

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualization of age and salary distributions  
   - Correlation analysis with purchase behavior  

3. **Feature Selection**  
   - Identifying the most influential features  

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Building classification models  
   - Evaluating performance using standard metrics  

---

## Key Insights  

- **Age** has a strong relationship with purchasing behavior  
- **Salary alone** is not a sufficient predictor  
- Combining multiple demographic features improves model performance  

---

## Model Performance  

- **Accuracy Achieved:** **91.25%**  
- Model evaluated using standard classification metrics  

---

## Tech Stack  

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
